USING REACT.JS IN THIS PROJECT ALLOWED ME TO DISPLAY SORTED AND FILTERED DUMMY DATA THAT I CREATED TO MIMIC DATA COMING FROM A BACK-END SERVER BASED ON USER FEEDBACK. I ALSO MADE USE OF STYLED COMPONENTS AND AN HIGHER ORDER COMPONENT. THIS ALLOWS THE USER TO INTERACT WITH THE UI IN ORDER TO SORT AND SEARCH CARS BY PRICES, BRANDS, TYPE, EXTRA FEATURES, FUEL TANK SIZE, ETCâ€¦ USING REACT'S CONTEXT API AS THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH TO MANAGE STATE AND HYDRATE ALL OF THE NECESSARY COMPONENTS WITH PROPS WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING PART OF THIS PROJECT.
